# WebWareBox

# NOTICE 
This README is describing the main goals I have for this project from the beginning and will not be updated, while the documentation for WebWareBoxV2 will be on the Wiki section and will be updated regularly. The source code for the base project is not mine.

# Main Goals
This is grounds for improvement for the WebWareBox program. I will convert this to Python/Django/Flask soon. Stay tuned or contribute to the project in the way of converting it to Python/Django/Flask. I will be creating documentation soon as well, preferrably once I convert it to Python/Django/Flask. I hope to make something good of this base PHP project. The main goal of the project was to allow for users to upload anything to a site. I could possibly integrate this into forums in order to allow users to upload folders full of files rather than just attach individual files. I was provided the source code by Anonymous, who asked to keep their name a secret, and the base PHP project will be archived either in a separate repository or in this repository in a tar.gz file.
